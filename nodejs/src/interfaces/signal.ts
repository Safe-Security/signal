/**
 * Signal
 * ======
 * Any kind of information about an asset that would be interesting from a security scoring point of view.
 * This specification is motivated and uses references from STIX specification. You will notice several attribute name
 * and description matching the [STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html) specification.
 *
 * [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange,
 * automated detection and response, and more.
 *
 * STIX has a far wider scope. While STIX is a well defined standard, its adoption within Security Products has been limited
 * as most Security products deals with a small aspect of Cyber Security. Most security products therefore provide STIX
 * interfaces to generate or consume STIX objects.
 *
 * Safe Signal focuses on understanding Signals which contribute to CRQ. This project will support importing and exporting to STIX format.
 *
 * Need for Signal spec when STIX is already present
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * STIX is a complex system, in the sense that it has a long learning curve. Its main goal is cross-collaboration between organization
 * to exchange Cyber Threat Intelligence. STIX is a connected graph of nodes and edges.  See STIX Spec document here. The SAFE Signal
 * specification is motivated by
 * - Those parts of STIX that can contribute to CQR
 * - Aligned to existing SAFE architecture, which focuses on a layered scoring system for CISOs.
 *
 * SAFE Signal spec as the step towards adopting all aspects of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence).
 *
 * Background and Requirements
 * ---------------------------
 * SAFE (as of June, 2022) understands CA, VA and EDR signals only. These are not all the signals that an organization has. Therefore
 * there is a need to ingest all interesting signals for a holistic scoring and risk calculation.
 *
 * String value convention for fields
 * ----------------------------------
 * There are several attributes of type
 * ```
 * string | SignalUrl
 * ```
 * SignalUrl is a reference to another signal where the details can be found. This allows non-repetition of some long strings.
 * Example:
 * The Signal.securityContext.remediation.description can be a bug paragraph. A submitter may be submitting the same signal for the
 * asset to the Signal Db on a regular or daily basis. There is no need to submit large para to be submitted in every signal.
 * A signal attribute can refer to another signal via the signal Url, via the signal.id field. So a submitter of a signal may references
 * it via SignalUrl as
 * ```
 * remediation = "signalurl://<id of the original signal>"
 * ```
 * The above will refer to the remediation text of the referred signal.
 *

     * STIX, CAPEC, ATT&CK
     * -------------------
     * STIXâ€™s Domain Objects (SDOs) include Attack Pattern, Campaign, Course of Action, Grouping, Identity, Indicator, Infrastructure,
     * Intrusion Set, Location, Malware, Malware Analysis, Note, Observed Data, Opinion, Report, Threat Actor, Tool, and Vulnerability.
     *
     * STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs) document the facts concerning what happened on a network or host.By associating SCOs with
     * STIX Domain Objects (SDOs), it is possible to convey a higher-level understanding of the threat landscape, and to potentially
     * provide insight as to the who and the why particular intelligence may be relevant to an organization.
     *
     * A single SAFE Signal contains an asset and its securityContext which maps to STIX's SDO and SCOs respectively. CAPEC provides a
     * comprehensive dictionary of known patterns of attack employed by adversaries to exploit known weaknesses in cyber-enabled capabilities.
     * It can be used by analysts, developers, testers, and educators to advance community understanding and enhance defenses. CAPEC is
     * focused on application security and describes the common attributes and techniques employed by adversaries to exploit known
     * weaknesses in cyber-enabled capabilities.
     * (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Session Fixation, Click-jacking).
     *
     * ATT&CK is a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior and taxonomy for adversarial actions across their lifecycle. ATT&CK has
     * two parts- Enterprise and Mobile. ATT&CK is focused on network defense and describes the operational phases in an adversaryâ€™s
     * lifecycle, pre and post-exploit (e.g., Persistence, Lateral Movement, Exfiltration), and details the specific tactics, techniques,
     * and procedures (TTPs) that advanced persistent threats (APT) use to execute their objectives while targeting, compromising, and
     * operating inside a network.
     *
     * #### How are they (ATT&CK, CAPEC, STIX) related to SAFE Signal?
     * Many attack patterns enumerated by CAPEC are employed by adversaries through specific techniques described by ATT&CK. STIX is a
     * specification that allows describing them.SAFE Signal is motivated by STIX.
